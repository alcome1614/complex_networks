The variables are global so they can be accesed by the other two methods. We used the karate club random graph. The observe method simply draws the network with two colors. Finally the update iterates through each node and consults to its neighbours in order to perform the majority vote. We added a probability to to change the state that is introduced in the dynamic_majority_vote.py script.\n"
